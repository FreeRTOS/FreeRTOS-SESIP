## Introduction
This project is an example of an IoT application using FreeRTOS.  This project was used to achieve SESIP certification for the FreeRTOS kernel. 

SESIP is an optimized security evaluation methodology, designed for IoT devices. For more information about SESIP, please see [the GlobalPlatform website](https://globalplatform.org/sesip/).

The security target document which describes the details of the certification can be downloaded from the [TrustCB Website](https://trustcb.com/download/SESIP-2000022-01-st/?wpdmdl=1930). A [copy of the certificate](https://trustcb.com/download/SESIP-2000022-01-cert/?wpdmdl=1928) is also available for download from the TrustCB website.
